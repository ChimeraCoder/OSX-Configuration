Configuration files for Arch 
===========================

This repo is for my configuration files for a Macbook Pro on 10.6, but this
branch is for the Arch VM I run in VirtualBox.

I use Arch with xmonad to manage windows kind of as a souped-up IDE.

great! If using them summons a tidal wave and earthquake that subsequently

anything you find here, I am not responsible.

Using this repo.
================

For people besides me, this is mostly useful as a boutique... say you've
just installed mutt for the first time, you can use this to see what a
(hopefully) reasonable mutt configuration looks like, integrates with gmail,
etc., at least something that works for one guy.

Automated install
-----------------

I use ``./make.sh`` to install the files here. You should probably not do that unless your cool with nuking your current config setup.
