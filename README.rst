Configuration files for OSX
===========================

My configuration files for a Macbook Pro on 10.6. 

I use a fair number of unix-y tools, so I've got a reasonably intense `vim`
configuration going on, and I've gotten `mutt` to play reasonably nice with
gmail. I'm also pretty happy with my `xmonad` setup.

Using this repo.
================

For people besides me, this is mostly useful as a boutique... say you've
just installed mutt for the first time, you can use this to see what a
(hopefully) reasonable mutt configuration looks like, integrates with gmail,
etc., at least something that works for one guy.

Automated install
-----------------

I use ``./make.sh`` to install them. Do this at your own risk.
