My configuration files for a Macbook Pro on 10.6. They are public domain...
if they're useful for you, great! If they summon a tidal wave and earthquake
that subsequently causes a level VII nuclear emergency in your country or
R'lyeh to rise up in your midst, or should any other travesty befall you by
using anything you find here, I am not responsible.

I use ``./make.sh`` to install them. Do this at your own risk. I think for people besides me, this is
much more useful as a boutique... say you've just installed mutt for the
first time, you can use this to see what a (hopefully) reasonable mutt
configuration looks like; at least something that works for one guy.
